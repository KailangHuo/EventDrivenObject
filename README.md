## EventDrivenObject

### Abstract:
Event Driven Design 
: This design purpose generally applied Publisher-receiver pattern
and abstract its core designation to an abstract class, with this 
implementation, a general instance is able to register its observer,
registered as other instances' observer and thereafter transmit its 
response by broadcasting in an event to all its observer.

Indexed event broadcasting among the system can also be solidated into 
database as a record during runtime which can help system analysis, and 
software slices.
